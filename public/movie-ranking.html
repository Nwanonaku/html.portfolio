<h1>All Time Best Movies According To Ifeanyi</h1>
<h2>Top 3 Movies</h2>
<hr>
<h3>1. BloodLine</h3>
<p>This felt so real to me while watching it. 
    It had my eyes glued to the screen all day till the end of each season. 
    Too bad season 2 was not as good</p>
<h3>2. Merlin</h3>
   <p>Wow! Who else remembers how sensational this series was?
     Gwendoline, Author and Morgana. 
      These guys killed it for me, perfect combo.</p>
<h3>3. Party Planner</h3>
<p>This one from Nigeria was another realistic commedy featuring Brother Shaggy. 
    If you really want to laugh out loud this one is for you.</p>
